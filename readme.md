This repository accompanies:
Bonnen, K.T., Czuba, T.B., Whritner, J., Kohn, A., Huk, A.C., & Cormack, L.K.  
(2019). Binocular viewing geometry shapes the neural representation of the 
dynamic three-dimensional environment. Nature Neuroscience.

This repository includes code for the 3D model described in the paper as 
well as accompanying analyses and psychophysical data. 

-----------------------
*Description of folders/files in top directory*

decoding: This folder contains 3 simulations which simulate from populations 
based on the 3D model, a von Mises model and an idealized von Mises model.

decodingResults: Analyses of model predictions generated by the scripts found 
in the decoding folder.

helperFunctions: A variety of support functions primarily for the 3D model.

psychophysics:  Psychophysical data and analysis code to plot the data.

Figure2_SingleNeuronExamples:  This script demonstrates how to visualize
individual neural tuning curves.  It can be used to see how the tuning shapes
change as tuning parameters and viewing distance change.
